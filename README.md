The goal of renverus is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of renverus from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("renverus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("steveputman/renverus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(renverus)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
